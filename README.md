# Smart_Home_sys_grp28
In the majority of domestic environments (homes), the presence of inflammable gases such as LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), methane and propane is highly risky. Gas leaks, when they are not detected, lead to catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, and health complications. In Uganda and the majority of developing nations, these risks are elevated since real-time monitoring and mitigation systems that are affordable are not readily available.
Moreover, the provision of comfortable and safe indoor environmental conditions i.e., temperature and humidity is essential for health, productivity, and conservation of goods. Overheating or overcooling of rooms can lead to discomfort and damage sensitive products. There is an evident need for a low-cost system that combines environmental control with gas safety functions.

This project proposes to design an intelligent embedded system for the detection of gas leakage and automatic mitigation by closing the gas valve, opening a fan for ventilation, alerting users using a sound(buzzer), display(LCD). The system also senses temperature and humidity of the room and activates a fan or heater accordingly. This dual-in-one system is designed to be reliable, modular, and low-cost making it suitable for home use thus realizing a smart home.
Below is a list of equipment we used ;i) dhtt 22; for sensing the temperature
ii) mq2 sensor for sensing the gas leak
iii)Arduino uno; this acts as the brains of the system
iv)buzzer; makes sound to alert if there is a gas leak
v)fans; these are used to cool the room if hot and airate the room if there is a gas leak
vi) LCD screen; displays the room temperature and also the gas levels in the room
vii)gas valve; controls gas flow
viii)heater; heats up the room if cold
ix)channel relay module; controls the systemâ€™s power
